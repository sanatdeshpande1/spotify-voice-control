# Spotify Voice Control

Spotify voice control is a personal project aimed at combining Speech Recognition and Spotify Web API to control Spotify devices by voice commands. The project is at a very early stage and I am yet to implement most of the error handling and refactoring the code.

Things in pipeline:

1. Better processing of user prompts using NLP and word tokenizer
2. Adding more Spotify functions including creating playlists, adding songs to playlists, getting song and playlist recommendations, etc
3. Code refactoring and error handling

I'll update this README as I keep working on this project.
