# Spotify Voice Control

Spotify voice control is a personal project aimed at combining Speech Recognition and Spotify Web API to control Spotify devices through voice commands. The project is at a very early stage and I am yet to implement most of the error handling and refactoring the code.
I have also integrated wit.ai for natural language processing and understanding user intents to make the voice control more robust.

The project currently supports media control (play, pause, skip track, previous track), search songs, create playlists, search and queue playlists, and add tracks to playlist.

Things in pipeline:

1. Recommendations based on user taste
2. User's top tracks, playlists and artists
3. Continuous addition of tracks to current queue if the queue is close to becoming empty
4. Wake word support and intent creation in wit.ai
5. Code refactoring and error handling

I'll update this README as I keep working on this project.
